# Emoji notes

An example project for
- Core Data (storing images + multiple managed object contexts)
- CollectionView (with custom Layout)
- Testing Core Data
- Animated shaking UICollectionViewCells for deletion (like the menu on iOS and IPadOS devices)

While incorporating an MVVM approach

Passing core data manager through the views and models, as well as the context.
Often just need to pass the context OR the core data manager as the core data manager in this implementation contains the contexts

Todo: Error handling (possibly implement in another example project?
